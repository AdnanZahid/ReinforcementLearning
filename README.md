# Reinforcement Learning

This is a simple Reinforcement Learning project written in Swift.

Basically, it navigates around a grid to find the goal (without knowing it before hand). Then it constructs an optimal path to the goal using model free reinforcement learning.

Here's a visual representation:

1. **_Green color_** represents Q-value
2. **_Red color_** represents failure node
3. **_Goal_** is to reach top-right corner
